# AFEW Emotion Recognition Challenge

## Requirements

Follwings are several necessary packages that must be correctly installed before running tests. We assume the working directory is at **src** folder. And please make sure that packages are installed directly under the **src** directory, or you have to fix some path dependence issue yourself. This project has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with Matlab R2015a.
